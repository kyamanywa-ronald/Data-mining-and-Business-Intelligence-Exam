# Association Rule Mining using Apriori Algorithm

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the Apriori algorithm to discover
frequent itemsets and association rules from supermarket transaction data.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- pandas
- mlxtend

## Part A: Data Preparation
Transaction data was prepared and transformed using one-hot encoding to make it
suitable for Apriori analysis.

## Part B: Apriori Algorithm
The Apriori algorithm was applied using:
- Minimum Support: 0.2
- Minimum Confidence: 0.5

## Part C: Interpretation
Strong association rules were identified based on lift values greater than 1.

## Conclusion
Apriori reveals useful buying patterns for decision making.
